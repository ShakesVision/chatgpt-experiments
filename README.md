# My Web Experiments
Welcome to my web experiments! This repository contains various web-based projects and experiments that I have worked on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Usually they are aided with GPT and are for testing purposes as a prototype of something serious.

Each project is contained in its own folder, and you can easily navigate through them using the main index page.

Since I had to manually deploy all these stuff usually on github creating a separate repo - I thought to create this repo which would collect all such stuff and I could add new folders, and add an entry in master (index) page linking individual projects. 

Made my life so much easier.
